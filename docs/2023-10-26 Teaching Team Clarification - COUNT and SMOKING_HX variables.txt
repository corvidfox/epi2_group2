Teaching team clarification on how `COUNT` and `SMOKING_HX` were calculated. Received by email 2023-10-26 07:28 AM CST.


# `COUNT`

"`COUNT` is the number of medications related to ICD-10-CM codes (E78.0, E78.0p) per participant.  RXDCOUNT is the overall number of medications reported by participants. For example, SEQN=110073 reported two cholesterol-controlling medications (Atorvastatin and Colesevelam). Many participants had one medications but some had two meds in the dataset."

# `SMOKING_HX`

"It was created using two variables (SMQ020 and SMQ040) to inform the quick history of cigarette smoking. Participants who refused or responded to 'don't know' were treated as missing." 

"SAS codes are:
IF SMQ020 = 1 AND SMQ040 IN (1,2) THEN SMOKING_HX = 2;
IF SMQ020 = 1 AND SMQ040 IN (3) THEN SMOKING_HX = 1;
IF SMQ020 = 2 THEN SMOKING_HX = 0 ; LABEL SMOKING_HX = '0-NEVER, 1-PAST, 2- CURRENT';
If you want to create more detailed smoking variables (e.g., # of average cigarettes/day), please add [P_SMQ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_SMQ.htm#SMQ020) dataset to your working dataset. Also, please check the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/tobacco/tobacco_glossary.htm) for more information"
