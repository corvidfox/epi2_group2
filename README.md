## Repository Organization

### /data
Contains data files
#### /CSV
Data files in comma delimited format.
#### / STATA
Data files in STATA database format.

### /R
Contains any and all written R scripts, such as helper functions. 

### /docs

## Style Guide

### Code
While we are using R, the general practices outlined in [Python's PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), especially [PEP20's Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), are ideal for collaboration and transparent review of code. Other points we've specifically highlighted:

- Lines of code should not extend past 80 characters for legibility
- Whitespace may aid with legibility but should be used conservatively, such as a single blank line between two different operations in a code chunk
- Code should contain descriptive comments
    - Someone should be able to look at the code and have an understanding of what it does and why
    - Code chunks that are data checks should have a top-line comment of "DATA CHECK:" followed by a description of what exactly it is checking for
- Code chunks should only have one output that is printed/displayed.
    - This is for legibility
    - Data Checks are the typical exception
- Variables
    - Descriptive names where possible
    - Use snake case (i.e. "variable_example") rather than camel case (i.e., "variableExample")
    - Avoid special characters and hyphens
    - Variable names should start with a letter (a-z), not a number or special character
    - Underscores are prefered over periods to separate words in variable names
- Files:
    - [Quarto documents (.QMD extension)](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) and [RNotebooks (.RMD extension)](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) are prefered, and both are compatible with [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
    - Functions should be separated into an R script and imported to the working document using `source(path)`
    - Pathing should be assisted with the [here() package](https://here.r-lib.org/) for R.
- File names:
    - Should be short and descriptive 
        - (i.e., "data_cleaning")
    - Sequential files should have a descriptive prefix, a two digit number, and a descriptive suffix. This ensures they are descriptive and fit in the proper order with a simple sort. 
        -  (i.e. "data_cleaning_01_nhanes_complaince")
    - Avoid special characters (except underscores and hyphens) and spaces
    - Do not make multiple versions of a file! This is what git version control is for! 

### Documents

- File names:
    - Should be short and descriptive
    - Should be in Title Case (i.e. "Example File")
    - Avoid special characters
    - Ensure extension is present (MAC systems sometimes cut off the extension)
- Do not make multiple versions of a file, unless otherwise agreed to work separately first before combining! This is what version control (git or GoogleDrive) is for!

### Images

- .PNG format is prefered, then .JPG
- File names:
    - Should be short and descriptive 
        - (i.e., "xaxisvar_yaxisvar_scatterplot", "var_histogram")
    - Sequential files should have a descriptive prefix, a two digit number, and a descriptive suffix. This ensures they are descriptive and fit in the proper order with a simple sort. 
        -  (i.e. "xaxisvar_yaxis_var_scatterplot_01_all", "xaxisvar_yaxis_var_scatterplot_02_outliers_excluded")
    - Avoid special characters (except underscores and hyphens) and spaces
    - Do not make multiple versions of a file! This is what git version control is for! 

## Project Design

### Research Question
What is the association, if any, between family income (family monthly poverty level) and endorsement of compliance with a prescribed cholesterol medication regimen among adults that endorsed being told they needed to take a prescribed medication for cholesterol?

#### Data Set:
Cross-sectional data from [NHANES 2017-prependemic 2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?cycle=2017-2020)

#### Study Sample:
Study participants who answered questions related to high cholesterol levels (BPQ080, BPQ060, BPQ090D, BPQ100D)  excluded participants with any cancer history

#### Exposure of Interest: 
Family income, respective to the poverty line

#### Outcome of Interest: 
Endorsed compliance with taking prescribed cholesterol medication

#### Potential Confounders & Other Variables of Interest:
- Health insurance status
- Race/Hispanic Origin
- Gender
- Age
- Educational Level
- Marital Status
- Other cardiovascular disease conditions
