# ⭐️Overview

This file seeks to perform initial exploration of the NHANES data, focused on the distribution of variables

# 📦 Load packages & Functions

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## 📥 Import the Data

We imported our cleaned NHANES data set.

```{r}
nhanes_path <- here('data', 'combined_data.rds')
nhanes_data <- readRDS(nhanes_path)

## Continuous Variable Distributions

Overall, we determined that:

-   Income Ratio (`income_ratio`) was not approximately normally distributed, with a bimodal distribution due to significant outliers at 5.

-   Age (`age`) was approximately normally distributed

-   Age at diagnosis of cardiac diseases were either approximately distributed, or had left skew

    -   Age at diagnosis of CHF, CAD, and CVA (`cvd_chf_age`, `cvd_cad_age`, `cvd_cva_age`)demonstrated left skew.

    -   Age at diagnosis of Angina, MI (`cvd_angina_age`, `cvd_mi_age`) were approximately normal

-   Alcoholic drinks per day (`alc_per_day`), BMI (`bmi`), total number of prescriptions (`rx_count_total`), and all activity variables (`active_mod_work_dur`, `active_transport_dur`, `active_mod_rec_dur`, `active_vig_dur`, `active_total`) had significant right skew

-   The total number of lipid-lowering medications had such a low range of values, it was functionally categorical.
